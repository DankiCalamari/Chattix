## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Messages aren't appearing in real-time

**Common solutions:**

2. **Refresh the page** - Reload browser tab
3. **Clear browser cache** - Remove cached data
4. **Check firewall** - Ensure WebSocket traffic allowed
5. **Try different browser** - Test in incognito mode

### Push notifications aren't working

**Troubleshooting steps:**
1. **Check browser permissions** - Allow notifications
2. **Verify HTTPS** - Push notifications require secure connection
3. **Check VAPID keys** - Ensure keys are correctly configured
4. **Test browser support** - Some browsers have limitations
5. **Check service worker** - Verify SW is registered correctly

### File uploads are failing

**Common causes:**
1. **File too large** - Check 16MB limit
2. **File type not allowed** - Verify allowed extensions
3. **Disk space full** - Check server storage
4. **Permissions issue** - Verify upload directory permissions
5. **Network timeout** - Try smaller files or better connection

### Application won't start

**Diagnostic steps:**
1. **Check logs** - Review error messages
2. **Verify configuration** - Check `.env` file
3. **Database connection** - Test database connectivity
4. **Port conflicts** - Ensure port 5000 is available
5. **Dependencies** - Reinstall Python packages

### Performance is slow

**Optimization tips:**
1. **Database tuning** - Optimize PostgreSQL settings
2. **Increase resources** - More RAM/CPU if needed
3. **Enable compression** - Nginx gzip compression
4. **CDN for static files** - Offload static content
5. **Database indexing** - Add indexes for frequent queries
